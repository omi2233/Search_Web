# Search_Web
Search web with ease 
Let this project handle the work of spending hours on simple web searches. 

Hi! Are you tired of searching the internet? This project automates the web search process. 
This project searches Google using the Google Search Module and scrapes web material using beautifulsoup. 

Then it summarises the results using the nltk library to provide you with a short, concise result in seconds, saving you minutes or even hours. 

Just clone this repo . Install all the requires libraries by 'pip install -r requirements.txt' command . 
now run the file with 'python -m {filename}.py' command
